This is the code behind the site http://media-maid.appspot.com.

I don't know that it adds a whole lot of knowledge to what is already out there, but maybe someone will find it beneficial to see how an actual running AppEngine site is set up.

If you have any questions, please feel free to email [mediamaidsite (at) gmail ].
